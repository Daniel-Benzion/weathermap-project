# NuStart Weather

This is a weather application utilizing HTML, CSS/BootStrap, JavaScript, and jQuery in combination with the OpenWeatherMap and Mapbox RESTful APIs via Ajax requests to deliver current weather and five-day weather forecasts to a user-defined location. Also includes an automatic dark mode/light mode style toggle based on the user's current local time.

Note: In order to build this application yourself, you will have to obtain (free) access tokens and API keys for both OpenWeatherMap and Mapbox.
